## Git configs

> Note that when using zsh + git plugin, it'll create aliases for

# Tips

<details>
  <summary>Git Aliases</summary>

```sh
# switch to a commit (detached state)
# create a branch from that commit
# then, checkout everything from that commit, to the latest one
git cp ..main
```
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Logging based on the action</summary>

```sh
# git history + changes
git log -p
```

Possible git filters
```
A	Show only added files
C	Show only copied files
D	Show only deleted files
M	Show only modified files
R	Show only renamed files
T	Show only files with type changes (e.g., file â†’ symlink)
U	Show only unmerged (conflicting) files
X	Show unknown files
B	Show only broken pairings (used for detecting broken renames)
```

> Note that you can combine multiple filters

<details>
	<summary>Generating a Patch file</summary>

```sh
git diff HEAD > ~/changes.patch
git apply ~/changes.patch
```

Note that this **won't work if you changed the external tool for git**, it **must** be the default (diff)
